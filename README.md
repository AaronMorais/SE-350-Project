Naming Conventions
------------------

Try to follow the existing code as much as possible. Most of it's following
more or less the same conventions now.

 - Types: **LikeThis**
 - Functions: **like_this**
 - Local variables: **like_this_again** (should have short names! :)
 - File global variables: **s_like_this** (must have static linkage, and should have fairly long names- typically several words.)
 - Project global variables: Don't. Ever.
 - Constants/enum values: **LIKE_THIS** (note, however, that the enum name is a type, and so should be LikeThis)
